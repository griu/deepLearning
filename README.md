Another attempt to learn by doing

## LSTM and ARIMA
I'm trying to reproduce some of the publications of Dr. Jason Brownlee found in Machine Learning Mastery, that I would like to agree their contribution to the open community of Data Science.

The first publication is [Time Series Forecasting with the Long Short-Term Memory Network in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/) because it looks an interesting exercicice to compare LSTM published in th Brownlee post with the classic techniques in this field like ARIMA that I will conduct with Python and R.

### LSTM
The goal of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is to learn long sequences of observations. It can be used in Time Series prediction but it has been popular in speech and image recognition problems and things so exotic like music composition.

As you can see in so didactic [Brownlee post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/) LSTM is applied to univariate time series forecastwith Tensorflow and Keras tools with Python with the next steps:
+ Data loading
+ Data preparation
+ Test design
+ Model training
+ Model evaluation

In this section I won't copy their findings that I will refer later in the model comparision section.
