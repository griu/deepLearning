Another attempt to learn by doing

## LSTM and ARIMA
I'm trying to learn the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) into the Time series forecast. In this way I will refer to some of the publications of Dr. Jason Brownlee of Machine Learning Mastery, that I would like to agree their contribution to the open community of Data Science. Also I will compare their results with classic model like Arima.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the goal to learn long sequences of observations. It can be used in Time Series prediction but it has been popular in speech and image recognition problems and things so exotic like music composition.

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is the classic method to forecast time series and is based in parametric models  

### LSTM
The first publication that I will refer is [Time Series Forecasting with the Long Short-Term Memory Network in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/). As you can see in so didactic Brownlee post, LSTM is applied to univariate time series forecast with Tensorflow and Keras Python tools in the next steps:
+ Data loading
+ Data preparation
+ Test design
+ Model training
+ Model evaluation

In this section I won't copy their findings that I will refer later in the model comparision section.

### ARIMA

To be continued...
